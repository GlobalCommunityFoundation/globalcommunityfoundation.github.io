            Traditionally considered as allied with the storks (Ciconiiformes), it was retained there in the
            Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy which lumped a massive number of unrelated taxa into their "Ciconiiformes". Based
            on osteological evidence, the suggestion of a pelecaniform affinity was made in 1957 by Patricia Cottam.[7]
            Microscopic analysis
            of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of shoebills closely
            resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the
            crystalline shells.[8] In 2003, the shoebill was again suggested as closer to the pelicans (based on
            anatomical comparisons)[9] or the herons (based on biochemical evidence).[10] A 2008 DNA study reinforces
            their membership
            of the Pelecaniformes.[11]
